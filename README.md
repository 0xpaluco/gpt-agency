# GPT-Agency: An Experimental Autonomous Agent Farm

<hr/>

## ðŸ›¡ Disclaimer: Project Under Development - Not Stable

Please note that the GPT-Agency project is currently in active development and should be considered as an experimental work in progress. As such, it may exhibit instability, unexpected behavior, or limited functionality.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Autonomous agents capable of understanding and generating natural language responses.
- Scalable infrastructure to handle a large number of AI agents simultaneously.
- Integration with various platforms and applications for seamless user experience.
- Adaptive learning and decision-making capabilities to improve agent performance over time.

## Next Steps

0. Develop the agent deployment infrastructure.
1. Train the initial set of AI agents using OpenAI's GPT models.
2. Implement integration with selected platforms and applications.
3. Test and evaluate the agents' performance, fine-tuning their abilities as necessary.
4. Continuously improve and expand the capabilities of the autonomous agent farm.
